# Connect Four

Classic & fun two player game. I used the pygame, sys, numpy & math libaries to make this game. In this project i have one py file. Game pieces are red & green with blue board & when someone wins the game i have a time wait delay and a reset function that takes you to a new game & with sys exit if you want to quit you can just exit out of the game.
