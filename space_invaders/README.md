# Space Invader

Classic space invader game created with pygame library. Also used sys, random & time library. 

Project consists of one python file with all the code & an asset folder that consist of an image folder & sound folder that contails all the images & sounds needed for my remake of the classic game. 

I have an opening image page load then goes to the main menu page that has the control buttons - which is space bar to shoot & arrows to move. click mouse button to start game. When you lose game it resets back to main menu page where you can click mouse button to play again or can quit the game by exiting out the window
