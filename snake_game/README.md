# Snake Game

Created classic, colorful & fun snake game using the libraries from sys, random, pygame & tkinter. Added the tkinter message box to pop up and give you your final game score & ask if you want to play again. Used the keyboard for the controlls for (up "w"), (down "s"), (left "a") & (right "d"). You can easily quit the game with sys exit
