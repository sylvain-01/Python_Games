# Tic Tac Toe Game

Classic two player game. I used the pygame, sys & time libaries to make this game. I made the game very colorful & nice looking with an opening image before it moves onto the game board. I also have interactive message dialogue of who's turn it is and who won/lost game or if it was tied & also have a clear red line draw through the winning three Xs or Os to show the winning line. In this project i have one py file & 3 image files.
